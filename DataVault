The Data Vault modeling technique is a hybrid approach designed to enable scalable, flexible, and resilient data warehouse architectures. It's based on three primary types of entities:

Hubs: Represent business concepts or objects, like Customer or Product. Hubs are identified by a unique key.
Links: Represent associations or relationships between Hubs. They are used to connect two or more Hubs together.
Satellites: Store the descriptive attributes or the historical changes of the Hubs and Links. Each Satellite is connected to one Hub or Link.
This approach separates the business keys, relationships, and descriptive attributes into distinct structures, which promotes agility and eases the integration of disparate data sources.
